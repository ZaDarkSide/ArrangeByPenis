Poor Sales Guy can't find anything ever since Web Dude rearranged his Windows icons. Web Dude claims "it is not possible to arrange by penis" but we know it can be done! Please help Sales Guy regain his sanity by writing a custom Windows plugin to arrange his icons by penis!

**Update:** Thanks to **Taktaal** for submitting a working **Arrange By Penis** program complete with source code. Both the program and the code have been graciously released into the public domain.

Requirements to run Taktaal's program:
- Disable "Auto Arrange" and "Align to Grid" on the desktop.
- Both .NET 1.1 and 2.0 must be installed.
- Windows XP or higher.

Have fun!
